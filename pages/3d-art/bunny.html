    <p>
        I designed all of this character from scratch. I started by creating silhouettes of what I am looking for, this was followed by another round of silhouettes because I didn't quite like any in particular. This lead me to getting feedback and then re-making my silhouettes. After I had a great character I started with sculpting the head. From there I sculpted the rest of the body. After some time of this I was plateauing on the project. I was then given some advice to add more details, this led me to using random ZBrush bits and added them to the model. I like what this did but I am not happy with the process. I had the mindset of just adding as much content as I could and because of this I wasn't thinking as thoughtfully on the project for a little while. After the sculpting was completed I re-topologized the model in Maya, this was a very time consuming activity but important for putting the model into engine. After getting a low-poly model I brought the model into Substance Painter and baked in the high-poly details. I also went through and textured the whole model. Then I brought the low poly model back into Maya and rigged it to a new skeleton. Something I learned after this project was completed was that you can stack UV's I was very unaware until I got feedback on the piece, so the I don't like showing the UV's off anymore because I now know they aren't very good. Overall I am really happy with the project because I was able to create a game ready character in the end.
