        As the development intern for NewPathVR I was responsible for creating a VR application from scratch. To do this I used Unity and the Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch controllers. I had to model a few objects for the simulation but most of my work was in the programming of the simulation. I was given an environment model of a house for one part of the application. The rest I had to create my self, this included a small wooded area to help the user to relax as well as an area where the user had to customize their experience.

        I used the 6DOF of the Oculus Touch controllers to allow the user select multiple options by physically moving objects. One example is I had a set of two boxes on a table to serve as buttons. When the user pushes one button down it stays and the other button rises. This works to visually inform the user they can only pick one option. I also had a miniature of their choice on the table that would change based on which button was down. Another interaction that I created was creating small figures that stood around and then they could be picked up and placed on a table to be counted. The simulation would then save the number of figures on the table for later. A fun feedback system I included an animation controller so that when the figures were lifted they would fail about like they were being held. 
        
        Another important aspect of this application was that I had originally developed it to be usable on the Samsung Gear or Oculus Go headsets but then pivoted later. Before pivoting, I had developed multiple methods to control the scene and input needed information mostly using the Gear Controller and where the user is looking with their head.    </p>
