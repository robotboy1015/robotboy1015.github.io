    Malech Excellence is the result of my Zbrush class final. We were given four weeks to come up with a sculpt. I decided that I wanted to sculpt a DnD character I had been playing with recently. I felt it was an original character and I wanted to make more than just a human. First I put together a reference sheet that included various pieces of fan art of tieflings in various roles such as rougues and pirates. I also collected photos of cosplay of pirates and tieflings and of paintings of pirates for reference. I then drew a concept for a few poses for the character. as well as a quick mash-up of images including screen captures from the Hellboy films.

              The first part of the project I worked on was making a realistic face so I loosely used the actor Luke Evans for reference for the face. Then I used Ryan Reynolds as a model for the body proportions. After getting a general shape of the character I really worked on making the face look intimidating and real. I started by making what the skull would look like for the character so I could use the landmarks in the face sculpt. I felt this was important because I had to come up with how tiefling skin works over demonic skull features and horns. I really referenced the Hellboy design with the horns and color in the end. I was considering doing two cut horns but that was too reminiscent of Hellboy so instead I decided instead to exaggerate the asymmetry of the sculpt and do one horn tip that was cut off.            </p>

              I wanted Malech to be a cool classic pirate so I made sure to include a eye patch but instead of the typical eye patch I went with more of a raggedy cloth band instead. This allowed me to practice with some fabric sculpting before I got to the rest of the clothes. I took a lot of inspiration of the clothing from the Assassin's Creed Black Flag costumes including the under shirt and large boots. The character's sword was just a typical cutlass, but I was trying to do new things by starting the model in Autodesk Maya and then bringing it into Zbrush after that I mostly did this for the practice. The coat fabric was a real challenge and I like how it turned out.  In the final that I submitted for the project I ended with a very quick pose and render so after finishing the semester I went back in to fix the pose as well as make better, well lit renders. I also went back into the hands and make them a lot more demonic to fit both the character and to reflect that he has to pull ropes all day.
